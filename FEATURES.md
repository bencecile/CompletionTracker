# Planned Features
- Be able to create a card for each game that you complete
    - It should have the console, the name, maybe the year, and an image for the background
    - Add something special for games that are 100% complete (maybe a gold star or trophy, and/or gold outlined card (like foil))
    - Be able to pick the ones you want to be collated on different sizes of paper, for printing
    - Have a couple different backs to choose from
        - This will only be able to work with double-sided printers
    - It might be cool if there was something that you could physically put on a card after you've got it to 100% completion
        - This way, you could print the card before you've 100%'ed it (You might not know if you can or will 100% a game)
- Create stats for the games played
    - Conglomerate the different platforms
    - Stats like trophies per day, with more good ideas on https://psnprofiles.com/ProdigalPhoenix
- "Link" Steam, PSN and XBOX Live
    - Publically available information only. I don't want to deal with logins from my site
    - Grab % complete achievements stats for the game
- Be able to scrape http://yomou.syosetu.com/ for the online novels
    - Just info and stats about each one, not the actual text
- Create a tool for admins to use to actually create the series of sources
    - Handcrafting everything in JSON is prone to error and time-expensive
- Create a graph showing all of the things that have been completed over time
    - Should be zoomable, and collect items on the month or year when zoomed out too far
    - Should be filterable by source type, time
- Create a list of things to do (games, movies, etc.)
    - Each item by default shouldn't have a priority (below anything that does have a priority)
    - General priorities can be given (1 - 5)
    - Each priority has a sub-priority to make it even more specific (nothing by default)
        - Follow the same default no-priority sorting rules as above
    - Should be generic and pertain to the item (play a game, watch a show)
        - Could get more specific (read book 2 of a series, or 100% a game)
    - They should disappear and be marked as done (hidden but expandable) automatically when something for the item is complete (a game has been started to be played)
        - Keep track of its old priority of when it was taken off this list
- Be able to sort the sources in a series either chronologically, or by release date
    - The same goes for the series in a Universe (if applicable)
- Be able to input mutliple completions of a source (re-watching or re-playing)
    - For games, be able to manually set the time played if there aren't linked services that keep track
    - Have a button to fill in the date as "Today", or have a manual input
        - Validate the date as YYYY-MM-DD
    - For games, a separate playthrough tracker might need to be set up to link the normal completion and 100% completion
        - This could just be a second completion after the normal one
    - If a game gets completed automatically from a service, the ability to edit time played is a must

# Linked Resources
## Sources
- Link a movie or TV Show that used a book as its base (ex. manga->anime adaptation)
- A VGMdb link to the source, if there one exists (music for the source)
