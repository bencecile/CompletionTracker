# ToDo
- Make a source completely self contained. It should only have stuff directly related to it.
- The universe tags should then reference a source
- The chronological order of sources should be separate from both universe tags and sources
- Use table of strings for each use in the Sources
    - 1 for names, 1 for descriptions, etc.
- Have a separate table for primary language strings
    - 1 of these accompanies each string table
    - Make these ID's the same as the Sources (since they'll be 1-1)
    - This way there's no doubly-linked references with less wasted space
- Don't split up the names and stuff by language
- Get rid of aliases and instead keep a list of names that are shown
- Source Create
- Source Read
- Source Update
- Source Delete

- Be able to complete sources
- Add a date field entry for the completed date of a source (UI)
- Add a "Completed Today" button (UI)
- Create a different view that is specifically for completing sources (should be the only place to do this)
    - Be able to search for sources and display the search results directly on the page
        - Show the source name, description(?), date input field, completed today button
    - Be able to search for other item types and pick one to generate the list of sources
        - Show the source name, the item type's name, date input field, completed today button
    - Format them in a table

- Make browser side settings
- Put content (source) lang in the Settings
- Put site language in the Settings
- Make a setting to change the time that "Today" changes (usually hours after midnight)
    - This is for the "Completed Today" button and probably other calculations

- Switch to hyper with async as much as possible
- Be able to complete things that aren't (yet) sources
- Be able to link completed entries with real sources (kinda retroactive)
